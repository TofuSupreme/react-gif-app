# React Gif App

# What is this app?

A simple yet dynamic SPA with a giphy API using React.js. 
Users can type in keywords into the search bar.
A number of results will appear.
User can also click on images on right panel which will then appear on left panel. 

Simple react starter with the following config:

- React, ReactDOM
- Webpack 4
- Babel with es2015 and react presets
- Bootstrap (css only, loaded from a cdn in `index.html`)
- work with `.js` or `.jsx` files
- main `application.scss` stylesheet is imported in `index.js` as a module to enjoy hot reloading
